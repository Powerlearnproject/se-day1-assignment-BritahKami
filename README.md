Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is an engineering discipline that is conserned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.
Software engineering provides structured methodologies that enables developers build high quality software.
Software engineering helps protect users from cyber threats by ensuring software meets security measures.
Software engineering helps users build applications that are user-friendly and one that meets users needs.
It enables developers to build software that can adapt to changes in user needs.
It minimizes development costs by following structured design principles.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of Software Engineering- software engineering was first discovered in 1968.
The advent of structured programming- Before 1970, developers used code that was poorly organized hence structured programming was 
invented in the 1970s as a solution to this crisis faced by developers.
Rise of Agile methodologies- In 2001, Agile methodology was invented as a solution to the rigid Waterfall model that was used by developers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- Here is where the developers determine what the software should do and allocate the resources needed for development.
Requirement analysis- Here the developers gather and document the non-functional and functional requirements that the software should achieve.
Design- In this phase developers create system architecture, UI design and database structures.
Implementation- In this phase developers write code and integrate it based on system specification.
Testing- In this phase the software is tested to check whether it meets users needs, it is also tested for bugs.
Deployment- this is where the software is released to users.
Maintainance- this is where developers provide updates for the software depending on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In Agile methodologies planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements while
in Waterfall model it involves inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages making it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
Waterfall model is appropriate for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites and where the requirements are well understood and changes will be limited during the design process while the Agile model is appropriate where frequent updates are necessary for example in game creation where features are added based on users feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Develops a functional software by writing and testing code.
Quality Assuarance Engineer- Identifies bugs and fixes them before the release of the software to ensure that the software works as expected.
Project Manager- coordinates the entire software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides tools that are needed for coding hence enabling software development for example Visual Studio Code while a VSC is an application that helps developers collaborate and manage different versions of their code for example GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Developers may face challenges in identifying and fixing errors in their code. The developer may overcome this by use debugging tools.
Developers may face a challenge in delivering a software project on time. The developer may overcome this by integrating Agile methodology hence breaking down tasks 
into managable sprints.
Misunderstanding between the developers or designers which may lead to not meeting users needs. This can be taken care of by scheduling regular meetings.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- this is where individual components are tested independently.
Integration testing- this is where different components are tested together.
System testing- this is where the entire application is tested as a whole.
Acceptance testing- this is where the system is tested with customer data to check whether it meets customer's needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is whereby a user gives well-structured prompts to an AI model so as to receive an accurate and precise response.
It saves on time because by receiving an accurate response it prevents a user from multiple attempts.
The user receives an accurate response because he or she gives a well-structured prompt.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Discuss Software Engineering - This is a vague prompt
Define Software Engineering and discuss the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle- Improved prompt.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear and specific on what needs to be covered unlike the first prompt which is broad and unspecific.
